# SoundCrowd
SoundCrowd is a passion project developed to allow users to upload their favorite songs and share them with others. Users can view each other's profiles to get a taste of the kind of music the other person enjoys, fostering a community of music enthusiasts. The application is built with the Django framework, powered by Python, and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
